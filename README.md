# uswsgi-connection-pool-plugin 

custom plugin for uwsgi that allows to pool connections between different endpoints.This is generally intended to work alongside Django framework of uwsgi. For example on how to integrate it with django please mail @abhimanyu.bhowmik5@gmail.com.

*Added support for connection-pool to rabbitmq servers, currently can only work with default exchanges
*Added support to read configs from postgresql database

The plugin works by creating pool of AMQP connections to multiple RAbbitMQ servers , which is reads from a config file or a database. 
It publishes the messages to RMQ queues in two ways,
-> A http post request to uwsgi
-> Using a zmq dealer socket
Expects the post request data/zmq send data in following format
		connection_id|rmq_queue_name|msg_to_be_sent
example         14|queue_123|test-message

It takes a config file as input parameter plugin-cgf-file, the cfg file accents the following parameters all are comma seperated
      config			details			values			examples
   UWS_USE_DB		enable or disable db		true or false		USE_DB,true
   DB_NAME		the name of db			string			DB_NAME,my-db
   DB_USERNAME		the username			string			DB_USERNAME,db-user
   DB_PASSWORD		auth password			string			DB_PASSWORD,db-password
   DB_HOST_ADDRESS 	the host addr to conn to	ipv4 address		DB_HOST_ADDRESS,127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT		the db port			integer			DB_PORT,5674
   NO_OF_CONNECTIOS	no of connections per rmqserver	integer			NO_OF_CONNECTIOS,5
   RMQ_CONN_STR		the rabbitmq connection string	string		RMQ_CONN_STR,id,user:pass@127.0.0.1:5672/vhost
   ZMQ_SOCK_ADDRESS	the ZMQ socket address		string			ZMQ_SOCK_ADDRESS,ipc:///tmp/feeds/0

if USE_DB is false all db related configs are ignored and connection is made using RMQ_CONN_STR configs.

the RMQ_CONN_STR accepts a id which is the connection_id of post or send data, there can be multiple RMQ_CONN_STR.
every id supports a backup server , to which msgs are published if primary is down, example
RMQ_CONN_STR,14,primary_user:primary_pass@127.0.0.1:5672/virtual_host,secondary_user:secondary_pass@127.0.0.2:5672/virtual_host

all libraries needs to be compile with -fPIC flag , have added precompiled libraries for Ubuntu 14.04 in libs/libs.

Installation 
-> get the uwsgi source from above link or any other uwsgi source code
-> compile and install uwsgi
-> inside uwsgi main directory look for plugins directory , mkdir uws-conn-pool
-> copy all files to created directory
-> switch to main directory, compile the plugin using
   	python uwsgiconfig.py --plugin plugins/uws_conn_pool/
-> if successful uws_conn_pool_plugin.so shoud be generated
-> copy this file to /usr/lib/uwsgi/plugins/
-> start uwsgi using a .ini file or using below command
	uwsgi --master --workers 2 --threads 2 --socket 127.0.0.1:9000 --plugin uws_conn_pool --protocol http --plugin-cfg-file pool.cfg
